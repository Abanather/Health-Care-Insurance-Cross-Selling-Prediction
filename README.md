# Health-Care-Insurance-Cross-Selling-Prediction

The purpose of this project is to determine which set of customers will be most likely to purchase vehicle insurance through the current healthcare insurance provider.
An insurance policy is an arrangement by which a company undertakes to provide a guarantee for specified loss and/or damage. Healthcare insurance companies are always looking to expand their businesses and serve more customers.
By predicting if a customer is likely to churn, a business could prepare and implement strategies to reduce the churn process.
Additional outcomes of the project include determining what attributes of customers make them show a high likelihood of purchasing auto insurance when cross-sold to.
